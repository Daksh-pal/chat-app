## Frontend

```bash
https://chat-app-frontend-theta-rose.vercel.app/
```

### It is only for preview coz I am not able to deploy backend. So to experience it fully, host the project locally.

## To host locally, Install Frontend and Backend dependencies.

### First the Frontend part

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Now the Backend part

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

## Setup the .env file

```bash
MONGO_DB_URI = Your MongoDB url
PORT = Your Port number
JWT = "123456789"
```

# Now run the Backend
```bash
nodemon index.js
```
